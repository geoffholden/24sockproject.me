      <description>Pair number five (socks nine and ten) is done. This one took a little longer, as the pattern took a bit more concentration to not lose my place.

      <description>This is pair number four complete, and less than two months in. I&amp;rsquo;m getting far enough ahead of pace that I might be able to take on some other projects and not let this one down. This was a new heel pattern for me, and I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure if I like it or not; I&amp;rsquo;ll have to see how it fits, but I usually like a contrast heel (partially for looks, partially so that I don&amp;rsquo;t run out of yarn) which this doesn&amp;rsquo;t really allow for.</description>

      <description>Socks five and six (pair three) have been completed. These are sport weight ones, so they went pretty fast, even with the pattern. I used two complete balls (less than 1g left over of each) of the main colour, and about 75% of a ball of the black.

      <description>The second pair have been completed. This uses up the last of the Drops Fabel that I have on hand. These knit up pretty quickly, especially after coming off a patterned pair.

      <title>Beard Hat</title>

      <description>I took a quick break from socks (as I&amp;rsquo;m currently ahead of schedule with three of twenty-four socks complete) to crochet my son a bearded hat for his birthday. It was a really quick project; if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to rip it out several times to get the fit right, it would have been finished in two evenings. It was my first time doing the &amp;lsquo;bobble stitch&amp;rsquo; for the beard&amp;ndash;they&amp;rsquo;re also not difficult, but they do slow things down a bit.</description>

      <description>The first pair of socks have been completed. I cast on the first one on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day, and started the second one on January 5. The texture sort of got lost in the print nature of the yarn, so I may revisit this pattern again later on a plain yarn. I would have gone for a single-colour yarn this time, but the only ones I have on hand are lighter, and I have to go down a needle size and up to a 72 stitch sock to not get laddering.</description>

      <description>I cast on these socks on the night of December 1. I wanted to see just how long it would take me to knit a pair of vanilla socks, to see how realistic this project actually is (for me, I know for some people twenty-four socks in twelve months is no stretch at all). This was certainly the fastest that I&amp;rsquo;ve knit a pair, it was less than two weeks in total, and I had a couple of evenings with no knitting at all in there.</description>

      <description>By day, I&amp;rsquo;m an entrepreneur, software developer, and electronics designer. By night, I&amp;rsquo;m a woodworker, knitter, and crocheter.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been knitting since October 2016 (and crocheting since June 2016), and have knit six pairs of socks before starting this project.
The goal of this site it to document my progress (and keep me honest) on knitting twenty-four socks (ideally twelve pairs) in 2018.</description>

      <title>Project Rules</title>

      <description>These are the rules that I&amp;rsquo;ve laid out for myself for the project so far. These are subject to change, but I suspect I&amp;rsquo;ll only make them more restrictive, not less.
 All socks need to be sized for an adult foot (baby and child socks do not count). All socks must be started and completed in the project timeframe. For a sock to be &amp;ldquo;completed&amp;rdquo; it needs to be bound off with all ends woven in.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this site is to document the progress of my 2018 goal to knit twelve pairs of socks (thus the 24 socks). I&amp;rsquo;ve been knitting since October 2016 (and crocheting since June 2016), and have knit six pairs of socks.
In preparation for the project, I have picked up Socktacular and Artful Arches from Knit Picks and enough yarn for five pairs of socks.</description>
