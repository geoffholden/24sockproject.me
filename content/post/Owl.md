This is my ninth completed pair. These ones went pretty quickly, just over two weeks to complete them. They're a little smaller than most of mine because I'm setting them aside for a Christmas gift. I decided to knit these early since I have the FlexiFlip needles for this yarn, but a lot of my other stashed sock yarn is lighter and I get laddering if I use the 2.75mm needles. I now have the 2.5mm and 2.25mm ones in hand, so I can proceed on the finer yarn for the next pair without going back to the real DPNs.
