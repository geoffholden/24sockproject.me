This pair took me what feels like forever to finish. I think it was mostly because of my attention being elsewhere in my down time, but it seemed like these socks were cursed to take a long time. For a while I didn't know if I'd manage to actually wear the cotton socks while the weather was still warm. In any case, they're done now; and that makes eight pairs and sixteen socks completed.

I did toe-up for these socks, because I didn't have any other cotton to do a heel with, and I didn't want to run out of yarn before I got to my toe. I like my socks to be fairly tall, so I usually have to do a contrast heel to be on the safe side of running out. The toe-up thing didn't impress me: having to use a different cast on, different bind-off, and increasing a bunch of stitches for the toe seemed like it was more troublesome than just starting at the cuff. I can only see myself doing it again in the same situation (not knowing how far the yarn will make it).
