Despite rumours to the contrary, I'm not dead. I haven't been knitting much in 2019 (still have to get back to that sweater I started at the end of last year), and the knitting I did do ended up being for Christmas gifts, so I'm holding off on posting those. I also started and ripped out a couple of socks because I was getting some laddering between needles; when this has happened in the past, I had to drop a needle size and switch to a 72 stitch sock, so those yarns are currently in detention until I get the motivation to knit with them.

I did finish the Christmas socks I started last year (and had them done in time for the holidays, but forgot to post them here).

I did just finish one pair of socks though, just a vanilla pair in Kroy, but it was enough to get my motivation back.
