The project is halfway complete. This is pair six, socks eleven and twelve. For these ones I tried out the new [addi FlexiFlips](http://www.skacelknitting.com/addi-Flexiflips/) DPNs, I'm not 100% sure on them yet, so I'm going to use them again for the next pair and then possibly write a little about them on there.
