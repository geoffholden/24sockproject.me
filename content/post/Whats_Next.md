What is next for the 24 Sock Project, now that all 24 socks are done? Well, I already have the leg of another sock knit; [Wool Trends](https://wooltrends.ca/) got some [Rellana Flotte Socke Christmas](https://www.ravelry.com/yarns/library/rellana-garne-flotte-socke-4-fach-christmas) in, so I decided to knit up a pair of Christmas socks.

Also, in a first for me, I've cast on a sweater. When I recieved the [Knit Picks](https://www.knitpicks.com/) flyer with the new [Dapper](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/sources/dapper) book, I ordered it, along with enough yarn for the [Rockland Sweater](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/rockland-sweater). This will be my first real "garment" knit; I've done hats, mittens, gloves, slippers, and obviously socks, but this will be my first really big knit.
