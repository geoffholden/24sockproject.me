Project success! I have completed my twelfth pair of socks this year. This pair was knit from the leftover yarn from the previous pairs. There were a *lot* of ends to weave, but I think it's a nice end to the project. I'm going to keep the website and [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/24sockproject/) live to document future projects.
